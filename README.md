# IGV
IGV - Intelligent Graph Visualizer

====================================

- Run "IGV.lnk" or "/bin/IGV.exe".

- Load graph examples from "/bin/GraphExamples/".

- Google "Graph".

====================================

IGV allows you to easily create and edit a graph, automatically places the graph on the plane (!!!), search for the minimal path (+coloring vertices), search center (+coloring), search vertices degree, search vertices eccentricity and others.

This is just the first version of the program, do not judge strictly :)

Features:
-automatically places the graph
-search shortest path (+coloring vertices)
-search center (+coloring vertices)
-search distance
-search eccentricity
-search nearest vertices
-search radius
-save to HTML
-create random graph

If you have any questions, suggestions or you just want to leave your feedback about the program, you can always find my contacts on my website http://www.alexnevsky.com.

I hope you find this program for yourself useful.

Best wishes,
Alex Nevsky
